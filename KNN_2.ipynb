        "Potential Drawbacks of KNN\n",
        "\n",
        "Computational Complexity:\n",
        "\n",
        "High Computational Cost: KNN requires computing the distance between the query instance and all training instances, making it computationally expensive, especially with large datasets. The time complexity is O(n⋅d), where n is the number of training instances and d is the number of dimensions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Memory Intensive: It stores the entire training dataset in memory, which can be impractical for large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sensitivity to Irrelevant Features:\n",
        "\n",
        "KNN can be negatively affected by irrelevant or redundant features in the dataset. These features can obscure the meaningful distances between data points, leading to poor performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Curse of Dimensionality:\n",
        "\n",
        "As the number of features increases, the distance between points becomes less meaningful, making it challenging for KNN to identify the nearest neighbors effectively. This phenomenon can lead to reduced accuracy and overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Imbalance:\n",
        "\n",
        "KNN can struggle with imbalanced datasets where some classes have significantly more instances than others. The model may become biased towards the majority class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Choice of k:\n",
        "\n",
        "Selecting an inappropriate value for k can lead to either overfitting (too small k) or underfitting (too large k). The optimal k can vary based on the specific dataset.\n",

        "Sensitivity to Noise and Outliers:\n",

        "Normalization/Standardization: Scale features to ensure they contribute equally to distance calculations. Standardization (zero mean and unit variance) or min-max scaling can help mitigate issues related to differing feature scales.\n",
        "\n",
        "Outlier Detection: Preprocess the data to detect and potentially remove outliers or noise. Techniques like z-score or interquartile range (IQR) can help identify anomalous data points.\n",

        "\n",
        "In scenarios where data is limited, especially in classification tasks, use data augmentation techniques to artificially increase the size of the training dataset. This can improve generalization and reduce overfitting."

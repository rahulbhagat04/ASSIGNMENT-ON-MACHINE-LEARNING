        "Regularization is a technique in machine learning that helps prevent overfitting by discouraging the model from becoming too complex. Overfitting occurs when a model learns not only the underlying patterns in the training data but also the noise and outliers, leading to poor generalization to new, unseen data. Regularization introduces a penalty to the model's complexity, effectively reducing its ability to overfit by constraining its parameter values or the number of features it uses.\n",

This penalty discourages large or complex coefficients (weights) in the model, forcing it to learn simpler relationships.

        "\n",
        "In L2 regularization, the penalty term added to the loss function is proportional to the sum of the squared values of the model parameters (weights). This penalty term forces the model to keep the parameter values small, effectively making the model less complex.\n",
        "\n",
        "λ is large, the penalty is strong, and the model is forced to shrink the weights towards zero, simplifying the model.\n",

        "\n",
        "How it Works:\n",
        "\n",
        "In L1 regularization, the penalty term is proportional to the sum of the absolute values of the model parameters. Unlike L2, which reduces the weights, L1 regularization can force some parameter values to become exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n",

        "Use Case:\n",
        "\n",
